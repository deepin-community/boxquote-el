Description: quote text in Emacs with a semi-box
 Provide a set of functions for using a text quoting style
 that partially boxes in the left hand side of an area of text.  A
 number of functions are provided for quoting a region, a buffer, a
 paragraph and a defun. There are also functions for quoting text
 while pulling it in, either by inserting the contents of another file
 or by yanking text into the current buffer.
